### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Myeongjin (Daniel) Wang, and I'm currently a high school student! My passion in Computer Science started during Covid-19 pandamic when I realised that with computer science knowledge, I could build video games, applications, and programs that could solve real-life problems! As a kid, I always enjoyed creating, crafting, and building with my creativity and imagination. I love to program in Java and Python. Sometimes, I also write codes with JavaScript and HTML. Other than programming, I love to play football (soccer), read books, and run!
