### Hello 👋

I'm Myeongjin (Daniel) Wang, and I'm currently an undergrad at the University of Toronto (Main Campus) studying Computer Science! My passion in Computer Science started during Covid-19 pandamic when I realised that with computer science knowledge, I could build applications that could solve real-life problems! As a kid, I always enjoyed creating, crafting, and building with my creativity and imagination. Other than programming, I love to read classical books, watch movies, run, and listen to musical!
